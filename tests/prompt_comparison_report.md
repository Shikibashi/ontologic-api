> The decision to pull the lever involves weighing the consequences of action versus inaction. Pulling the lever would save five lives at the cost of one, while doing nothing would result in the death of five. The ethical dilemma centers on whether it is morally permissible to sacrifice one life to save five, or whether it is wrong to actively cause harm, even if it prevents greater harm. The answer depends on one's ethical framework—utilitarianism may justify the action, while deontological ethics might condemn it.

> The modern formulation of the trolley problem asks whether a bystander ought to divert a runaway tram from a track where five workers will surely die to a side track where one worker will be killed. A utilitarian analysis centers on the arithmetic of consequences: Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill would urge us to evaluate which action maximizes overall well-being. From this vantage point pulling the lever is morally justified because sacrificing one life preserves five, yielding the greatest net utility. Contemporary utilitarians additionally emphasize rule-consequentialism, arguing that adopting a general policy of minimizing total harm would, in most analogous situations, recommend intervention.

A deontological perspective, inspired by Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, resists this calculus. The imperative to treat persons always as ends in themselves forbids using the lone worker merely as a means to rescue others. Even if refraining from action allows five deaths, the deliberate redirection of harm instrumentalizes the single worker and violates the duty not to kill the innocent. Some Kantians differentiate between doing and allowing, asserting that moral agents bear stricter obligations against intentional harm than against permitting misfortune.

Virtue ethics reframes the dilemma by asking what a fully virtuous agent, cultivated through phronesis, would do. An Aristotelian analysis situates the choice within the agent's character, community commitments, and the habituated disposition toward compassion, courage, and justice. The virtuous agent would deliberate about the particulars, showing sensitivity to human relationships and to the kind of person she strives to become. She may ultimately pull the lever, perceiving it as the least vicious action available, yet she does so with tragic awareness rather than cold calculation.

Beyond the canonical frameworks, care ethicists highlight the relational texture absent from abstract puzzles. Who are these workers? What responsibilities connect them to the agent? Likewise, contemporary moral psychologists observe that emotional responses — empathy, aversion to harm — shape our intuitions, suggesting that moral agency involves harmonizing reason and sentiment. The trolley problem endures precisely because it exposes tensions among maximizing good outcomes, honoring moral rules, and embodying virtuous character.

> The decision to pull the lever involves a moral dilemma between minimizing harm and respecting individual rights. Pulling the lever would save five lives but sacrifice one, while not pulling it respects the single worker's autonomy but risks five deaths. The choice reflects ethical principles such as utilitarianism, which prioritizes the greater good, or deontological ethics, which emphasizes moral duties and individual rights. The answer depends on which ethical framework one prioritizes.
