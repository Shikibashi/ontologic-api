## Verification Task

Carefully analyze the above content and create a systematic verification plan. For each factual claim that can be verified against authoritative sources, provide:

### Output Format

For each verifiable claim, provide:

**Claim [N]:** [State the specific factual claim]
**Type:** [Historical Fact | Textual Claim | Scholarly Consensus | Conceptual Definition | Causal/Influence Claim]
**Verification Questions:**
1. [Specific search question 1]
2. [Specific search question 2]
3. [Specific search question 3] (if needed)

### Guidelines for Verification Questions

1. **Be Specific**: Questions should be precise enough to yield clear, factual answers
2. **Target Authoritative Sources**: Frame questions to find information in canonical texts, scholarly sources, or authoritative references
3. **Avoid Interpretation**: Focus on factual content rather than interpretive claims
4. **Enable Search**: Questions should work well with search and retrieval systems

### Example Format

**Claim 1:** Aristotle wrote the Nicomachean Ethics around 350 BCE.
**Type:** Historical Fact
**Verification Questions:**
1. When was Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics written?
2. What is the scholarly consensus on the composition date of the Nicomachean Ethics?
3. What primary sources provide evidence for the dating of Aristotelian ethical works?

**Focus only on claims that can be factually verified—do not create verification questions for legitimate interpretive arguments or philosophical positions.**
