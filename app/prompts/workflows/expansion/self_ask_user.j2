## Original Query to Decompose

**Query:** {{ query }}

{% if context %}
**Additional Context:** {{ context }}
{% endif %}

## Task

Decompose this complex philosophical question into 3-7 specific, targeted sub-questions that can be researched and answered individually. These sub-questions should collectively provide the knowledge needed to comprehensively address the original query.

## Output Format

Provide your decomposition as a numbered list:

**Sub-Question 1:** [Specific, research-focused question]
**Sub-Question 2:** [Specific, research-focused question]
**Sub-Question 3:** [Specific, research-focused question]
[Continue as needed...]

## Guidelines for Each Sub-Question

- **Be Specific**: Include references to particular philosophers, works, concepts, or time periods when relevant
- **Target Primary Sources**: Frame questions to find information in canonical philosophical texts
- **Enable Research**: Questions should work well with search and retrieval systems
- **Build Systematically**: Order questions logically to develop understanding step-by-step
- **Cover Completely**: Ensure all aspects of the original query are addressed across the sub-questions

## Example

For a query like "What is the relationship between virtue and happiness in ancient ethics?"

**Sub-Question 1:** How does Aristotle define eudaimonia in the Nicomachean Ethics?
**Sub-Question 2:** What is the relationship between virtue (arete) and eudaimonia in Aristotelian ethics?
**Sub-Question 3:** How do Stoic philosophers like Epictetus define virtue and its relationship to happiness?
**Sub-Question 4:** What are the key differences between Aristotelian and Stoic views on virtue and happiness?

**Focus on creating questions that will yield concrete, specific information about philosophical concepts, arguments, and texts.**
